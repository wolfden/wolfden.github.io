<h1>Google Chrome</h1>
<p>Google Chrome runs web pages and applications with lightning speed. I choose to go with Google Chrome because I absolutely love the sync feature that is built in. No matter where I am at in the world, as long as I have internet access and google chrome, I can sync my browser so all my bookmarks and themes go where ever I go. This does require you to have set up your stuff before hand and a google account, otherwise it is hard to sync to anything.
<br><br>
By default you start up the browser and none of your bookmarks are there, so lets sync. Click the wrench and go to Preferences -- Personal Stuff tab and Setup Sync
<br>
Log into your google account
<br>
And now you can see, my stuff is all there. Can't stress enough how much easier this makes things.
