<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Username & Passwords</h2>
<p>There is two accounts, root account and sabayonuser account. There is no password for either account, so if you get asked for a password, just hit enter. For instance, when you need to su to the root account, you will get prompt for a password, just hit enter. So in terminal:
<br><br>
sabayonuser@sabayon ~ $ su<br>
Password:<br>
sabayon sabayonuser #<br>
Note the #, this represent that you have successfully changed to root account.
